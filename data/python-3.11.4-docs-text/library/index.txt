The Python Standard Library
***************************

While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and
semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual
describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It
also describes some of the optional components that are commonly
included in Python distributions.

Python's standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of
facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below.
The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide
access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise
be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in
Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that
occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly
designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs
by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the
entire standard library and often also include many additional
components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally
provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use
the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some
or all of the optional components.

In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of
hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and
modules to packages and entire application development frameworks),
available from the Python Package Index.
