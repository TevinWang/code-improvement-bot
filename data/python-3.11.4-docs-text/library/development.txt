Development Tools
*****************

The modules described in this chapter help you write software.  For
example, the "pydoc" module takes a module and generates documentation
based on the module's contents.  The "doctest" and "unittest" modules
contains frameworks for writing unit tests that automatically exercise
code and verify that the expected output is produced.  **2to3** can
translate Python 2.x source code into valid Python 3.x code.
