Frame Objects
*************

type PyFrameObject
    * Part of the Limited API (as an opaque struct).*

   The C structure of the objects used to describe frame objects.

   There are no public members in this structure.

   Changed in version 3.11: The members of this structure were removed
   from the public C API. Refer to the What's New entry for details.

The "PyEval_GetFrame()" and "PyThreadState_GetFrame()" functions can
be used to get a frame object.

See also Reflection.

   The result (frame code) cannot be "NULL".

   New in version 3.9.

PyObject *PyFrame_GetGenerator(PyFrameObject *frame)

   Get the generator, coroutine, or async generator that owns this
